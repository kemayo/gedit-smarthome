=======================
Smart Home Gedit Plugin
=======================

Intro
-----

gtksourceview2 has a nice bit of behavior called SMART_HOME_END, which makes
the home key go to the start of the indentation on a line before going to the
very beginning of the line. It was one of my favorite things about Scintilla,
and I'm glad gtksourceview2 grabbed it.

This plugin enables that behavior in Gedit.

Install
-------

Put ``smarthome.gedit-plugin`` and ``smarthome.py`` in the ``~/.gnome2/gedit/plugins``
directory. You might have to create it first.
